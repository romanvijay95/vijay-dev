Hi, I'm Vijay 👋

PL/SQL • ETL/Data Migration/SQL Loader • Unix/Linux • Oracle & SQL • Automation

👨‍💻 About Me

💼 I design and build data/ETL pipelines and Oracle PL/SQL solutions with a strong focus on performance tuning & deployment automation.

🔭 Currently learning: advanced SQL tuning, Linux tooling, and DevOps practices.

🧰 Tech Stack

Databases: Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL

Scripting & Tools: PL/SQL, SQL*Plus, Shell/Unix scripting, GitHub Actions

ETL / Data Migration: SQL Loader, SSIS

Automation: PL/SQL deployment, GitHub CI/CD, Linux scripting

💡 I enjoy turning messy processes into reliable, automated systems.

🚀 My Work Involves

🔄 Data Migration

From upstream sources → database (Excel, flat files, APIs).

From database → downstream systems (reporting, dashboards, external systems).

⚙️ Automation & Monitoring

📧 Email alert automation for job failure/success.

📊 Hourly stats refresh jobs.

🗑️ Error log table purge & maintenance.

📥 Automated feed loading status tracking.

🚨 Error log alert automation with notifications.
